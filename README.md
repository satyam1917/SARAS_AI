AI has changed the sector of education through colossal growth in personalized learning, automated grading, and intelligent curriculum design. The AI in education market, valued at **US$ 2.5 billion** in 2022, is projected to reach as much as **US$ 88.2 billion** by 2032. In just AI-driven personalized learning, huge growth is foreseen. 

Despite all these advances, several gaps are found within the current AI solutionsá…³for example, limited tailoring in personalized learning, biases in grading systems, and inaccessible access for underserved populations. This is an opportunity where, with due time, more holistic and inclusive AI systems will be effectively developed to meet the various needs within education. 

I've gone ahead to research the flaws of the current crop of AI chatbots, citing limitations like static knowledge bases and not being able to learn in real time, among others. Improving their application, therefore, needs to give users a more **human-like experience with AI** systems, reduce biases, and improve their sensory responses. In light of these challenges, I have developed **SARA AI**, a Tutor AI that assists students in several tasks like keeping **track of progress**, completing assignments, **generating tests**, analyzing performance, and extracting knowledge from the web. SARA AI does this through cutting-edge models such as **Meta-Llama-3.1** and **RAG** for educative support that is both personalized and contextually relevant. 

The future holds enormous potential for SARA AI. Some of the future improvements may be in sophisticated **personalization**, **multilingual** support, integration with AR/VR, better accessibility, ethics in AI practices, and integration into academic institutions. All these developments will give an effective, inclusive, and secure AI-driven educational experience.
